//! The node's CLI console: where the harness talks to the stack.
//!
//! A copy of the `openthread` repo's `tests/shared/console.rs` (this crate
//! deliberately depends on `openthread` and not the other way around, so the
//! file cannot be shared by path). Keep the two in sync.
//!
//! The board decides which binding exists, so this is the part that varies:
//!
//! - **UART** (default): `UARTE0`, for a board with a UART-to-USB bridge - an
//!   nRF52840-DK's J-Link virtual COM port, or a plain USB-serial adapter on
//!   two pins.
//! - **USB CDC** (`console-usb`): the nRF's own USB peripheral, presented to
//!   the host as a serial port - for a board whose only serial port *is* USB,
//!   like a XIAO nRF52840 or an nRF52840 dongle, neither of which has a bridge
//!   to talk through.
//!
//! Everything here is binding-agnostic on purpose: a console is a byte sink
//! plus a byte source, and only the two tasks that move bytes to and from the
//! wire care which peripheral is underneath.
//!
//! # Why output goes through a pipe
//!
//! OpenThread's CLI hands its output to a **synchronous** callback, called from
//! wherever in the stack the command happened to be. USB CDC has no synchronous
//! write - a packet write is an `await` - so a callback cannot write to that
//! device at all. It fills [`OUT`] instead, and a task drains that to the wire.
//!
//! The UART binding could have written synchronously, but goes through the pipe
//! anyway: it is the shape USB needs, and it keeps the stack from blocking on a
//! byte-by-byte UART while it is servicing a radio.
//!
//! Overflow drops output rather than blocking. A blocked write here would stall
//! the stack (including the radio it is driving), and the harness reports a
//! truncated line far more usefully than it reports a node that stopped
//! breathing.
